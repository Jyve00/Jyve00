## My name is Stephen William and I specialize in Speech Recognition, Audio Classification, and Natural Language Processing. Welcome to my Github!



### Here are some of my completed projects: 

## [Emotion Speech Detection](https://github.com/Jyve00/Emotion_Speech_Detection) 
![alt text](https://github.com/Jyve00/Emotion_Detection-/raw/main/images/speech.png)

Audio Classification for recorded speech using audio feature extraction and augmentation feed into a Convolutional Neural Network. The model has an accuracy of 70% and uses Librosa for audio preprocessing and Tensorflow for the Machine Learning models. 


## [Music Information Retrieval](https://github.com/Jyve00/MIR)

Music genre classification using the [GTZAN Dataset](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html) and extracting important features like mel-spectrogram and MFCC. Multiple Machine Learning techniques where attempted and the best result was a model with 4 2 dimensional Convolutional Neural Netowrk layers each with MaxPooling and Batch Normalization. The model achieved a 73% training accuracy. 


### Here is what I am currently working on" 

## [Speech Recognition](https://github.com/Jyve00/Speech_Recognition)

Speech Recognition experiments using the latest Deep Learning methods and feature extraction and augmentation techniques. I will be using popular speech datasets including TensorFlow's Speech Commands and the LibriSpeech ASR corpus. I will be using PyTorch for most of the audio data preprocessing and transformations as well as the Deep Learning models.
