### My name is Stephen William and I specialize in Speech Recognition, Audio Classification, and Natural Language Processing. Welcome to my Github!


Here are some of my completed projects: 

## [Emotion Speech Detection](https://github.com/Jyve00/Emotion_Speech_Detection) 
![alt text](https://github.com/Jyve00/Emotion_Detection-/raw/main/images/speech.png)

Audio Classification for recorded speech using audio feature extraction and augmentation feed into a Convolutional Neural Network. The model has an accuracy of 73% and uses Librosa for audio preprocessing and Tensorflow for the Machine Learning models.
